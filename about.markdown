# **Introduction**
- Hi, Iâ€™m mshong, with a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.
- I worked as an cooperation professor at Korea University for 5 years, teaching **Signals and System** and **Discrete Math**.
- I'm currently employed at [Sapien Semiconductor](http://www.sapien-semicon.com), a fabless company where my work involues **algorithm development using Python** and **IP design using Verilog HDL**.
- I have been developing video compression technologies, display technology, and image processing mostly.
- Lately, I have been interested in machine learning and deep learning with Python.
- You can reach me at mshong328@gmail.com.

# **Recent Verilog HDL Projects:**
I have recently developed the following projects using Verilog HDL:

1. **DSC(Display Stream Compression)**: A video compression standard developed by VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) that is used to reduce the amount of data needed to transmit high-quality video. More information can be found at [DSC](https://vesa.org/vesa-display-compression-codecs/#tab-dsc).

2. **VDC-M(Video Display Compression M)**: Another video compression standard developed by VESA that is designed for high-end displays, such as those used in medical and aerospace applications. More information can be found at [VDC-M](https://vesa.org/vesa-display-compression-codecs/#tab-vdc-m).

3. **De-Mura Compensation**: A technique used to compensate for stains that may appear in the process of producing uLED/OLED displays.

4. **Dead Pixel Compensation**: A technique used to compensate for dead pixels that may appear in the process of producing uLED/OLED displays.

5. **Bilinear and Bicubic Scaler**: Algorithms used to increase or decrease the size of an image while maintaining its quality.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to discuss any projects related to these topics.
